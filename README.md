## Mission

You're tasked with improving this ficticious app we are creating!

As an engineer you are not expected to know everything of everything, just take this opportunity to show you range of skills and be pro-active on communication.

Please try making contribution to as many challenges presented, even if not able to complete them to 100% satisfaction. Suggest to prioritize them like this: **What actions I can take to create most value in this small test time?**

This assesment focus on 3 main points, with focus on the front end:

1. React
2. CSS
3. Node.js server

Feel free _to Google_ and _communicate_ as progress is made, or if you hit a roadblock.


## Tasks:

### 1. Add some visual status

We need to display a counter for the tasks.  
The new app title should be `TO DOs <complete>/<total>`  

### 2. CSS/Design style complete tasks

Let's change how the complete tasks look like.  
Right now it's just a strike over, change it to class and add some style to it.  
Also, the "Complete" button shouldn't show for tasks that are complete.  

### 3. React talking to an API

Call a server to store TODO data.  
Also use the data from the server to populate the app on start.  
See ./server folder for the simple server implementation and endpoints  

### 4. Node persist data in a JSON file

All tasks are living in memory, but can we save them to a json file as they come in?  
Would also be great if you load data from the file at the server start.
